# 🚗 Dynamic Pricing Prediction

A machine learning project that predicts Uber and Lyft ride fares using historical ride data from Boston, MA. The project covers the complete workflow from data preprocessing and feature engineering to model training, evaluation, and deployment with Streamlit.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Ride prices on platforms like Uber and Lyft change dynamically based on factors such as distance, ride type, surge pricing, and time of day.

The objective of this project is to build a regression model that can predict ride fares using these features.
